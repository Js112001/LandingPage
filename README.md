# LandingPage
This is a landing page which I designed just like the one on the [geeksforgeeks website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/). 

## What I learnt?
In this project, I learnt how to create cards using pure html and css. 
For layout of the first section I used **flex box**. And for the rest of the section I used **grid layout**.
Apart from this, for remaining layout issues I used media queries.
Devices which I considered while making this page responsive are listed below:
- iPad and iPad Pro
- Galaxy fold
- iPhone 5, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 plus and iPhone X

## Wrapping up
For a better folder structure, just make a separate folder for all images. But, remember you have to specify the path to the images via the new folder.
